📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024 to address challenges faced by farmers in accessing fair markets. Traditional supply chains often involve middlemen, resulting in reduced income and limited transparency for farmers.

The proposed solution is a digital marketplace platform that connects farmers directly with consumers and retailers, enabling fair pricing, efficient order management, and improved market reach.
